					<p>In the spring of 2014 Kamna and Ryan were both set out on a similar path to focus and advance their careers through Villanova University's MBA program. Even though they started the program one year apart from each other, they had one class together. This was not just any class. It was Ryan’s last and final class of the MBA program, and it was a class that would unite the two. </p>

					<p>About a month prior to the start of the course in Italy, the class met for the first time at a small Italian restaurant for dinner. It was a group of about 12 people, and at dinner everyone spoke about their MBA experience, their careers, and expectations of traveling to Milan, Italy. Little did Kamna and Ryan know that this would be the start to a beautiful relationship. </p>

					<p>Over dinner, Kamna mentioned that she needed help in her finance/accounting class, which was Ryan’s expertise. This gave Ryan an opportunity to offer his help and obtain her phone number. Over the course of the weeks leading up to the trip, Ryan and Kamna texted back forth. Despite Ryan’s efforts of flirting, which she was completely oblivious to, Kamna rejected him for a date prior to traveling to Italy. </p>

					<p>A month later, the two reunited in Florence, Italy, where they traveled to a few days prior to beginning of their course in Milan. While they were in Florence, Kamna and Ryan explored the city, enjoyed the food, and basked in city's history. Everything was going perfectly, until Kamna decided to take pictures of the cathedrals and buildings while the rest of the group kept marching forward. This was a pivotal moment for the two of them. Ryan decided to stay with Kamna to make sure she would be able to find the group again, but the two were separated from the rest of their peers. After searching for the group for what seemed like an eternity, they decided to continue exploring Florence on their own. The two of them walked around the city and ended their night at an Italian restaurant which they would from then on refer to as their first date.</p>

					<p>After that night in Florence, Kamna and Ryan were inseparable. They traveled together to Rome and Switzerland, and continued their relationship back in the United States. Ryan and Kamna knew they were meant for each other from the start, and their status changed from "In a Relationship" to "Engaged" on November 20th, 2016.</p>

					<p>Ryan knew Kamna wanted a small and intimate proposal. They both left work early on November 20th, 2016 so that they could beat traffic and make it down to Atlantic City for one of their closest friends' birthday. Little did Kamna know that it would be the day that would change their lives forever. She walked into Ryan's apartment at about 3:00 PM on that day to find flowers put out for her in a water jug on his kitchen counter. She thought nothing of it, as these are fairly common gestures. Kamna turned to her left and saw probably more than 20 or so vases full of beautiful, colorful flowers laid out all over his apartment and Ryan sitting down with his guitar in hand. She immediately thought of the field of flowers in one of her all-time favorite Indian movies, which Ryan had actually agreed to watch with her earlier in their relationship. Ryan played his guitar and sang 3 songs for Kamna: The First Day of My Life by Bright Eyes, Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton, and All of Me by John Legend. After lots of tears and awkward laughter, Ryan got down on one knee and asked Kamna to marry him, to which her response was, "You're holding the ring upside down. Did you get the ring insured? This is so awkward." It was the most perfect day ever, even though she never actually said yes!</p>
