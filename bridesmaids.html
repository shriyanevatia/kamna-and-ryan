									<p>PSU<i class="em em-point_right"></i>PHILADELPHIA<i class="em em-point_right"></i>THE FUTURE(WEDDING DAY)<br>Since I met Kamna my freshman year of college at Penn State, she has been nothing short than an older sister and role model to me. From my education goals to my career choices of pursuing my nursing dreams, she has been rooting for me and offered every bit of advice and assistance along the way.  Despite having our own lives and sometimes not seeing each other for months, she never makes it feel like a day has gone by where I haven't talked to her. Every catch up, and every meeting make it feel like we never stopped talking.I am elated that I am able to share yet another event with her, and this being one of the best days of her lives, I am so excited for her to take the next step into her future as MRS. Abraham.<br>"Our paths may change as life goes on, but the bond between friends remains ever strong." -Unknown</p>

										<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
										<p>Kamna is my goofy twin. In the 7th grade when I moved to Montville, Kamna welcomed me to sit at her lunch table and our friendship flourished from there. We made a silly bet that year that ensured we'd be friends until we graduated high school, but our friendship continued to thrive way beyond. From playing flute in a concert, to watching a concert down the shore, travels ranging from Applebees in Parsippany to the pink sand beaches of Bermuda, from sleepovers to long phone calls, our memories are plentiful. I'm so excited to create new memories with Kamna and Ryan as they walk down the aisle. </p>

								<p>It's hilarious thinking about how Kamna and I first met. We met through a mutual friend and let's just say first impressions were not everything. Fast forward to now and I am a bridesmaid. Kamna in a short time became my soul sister, the big sister I never had! I know I can turn to her for anything and she will graciously always be there for me with arms wide open. I'm ecstatic for this beautiful soul to get married to the love of her life and am humbled to be a part of it.</p>

								<p>"Rare as is true love, true friendship is rarer." I got to meet Kamna through a mutual friend of ours, as we both along with a few other friends put together a competition in Philadelphia. Little did we know that planning a weekend together would lead to an outcome of lifetime worth of friendship. Kamna has been there as a great friend through every step of the way and I am thrilled to be her bridesmaid and vice versa! Love you!</p>

								<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
								<p>I'm happy to say I'll be joining this beautiful couple on their wedding day. My name is Erica and I'm from Klingerstown, PA (don't worry, no one has ever heard of it). I grew up on farm lands, so moving to the Philadelphia area was certainly a culture shock. Working for Johnson &amp; Johnson brought me to meet Kamna and what a blessing that was. Finding someone with the same quirky humor I have, is rare. In my spare time, I love working out, CrossFit especially. My friends call me a fashionista and I own that title every day ;) Spending time with my friends is key. I'd rather put the phones away and chat then be on social media all day, that's quality time. I'm SUPER pumped to celebrate this special time and can't wait to meet everyone soon!!!!!!! XOXO-Erica</p>

								<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
								<p>My name is Kinara and I met Kamna at Penn State in 2010! I remember her meeting her for the first time when she approached me in a hallway while I was studying for an exam. She just came and started a conversation with me (I don’t even remember what it was but I remember thinking “who is this girl?!”) and then she convinced me to join aKDPhi! &hearts; Ever since then, she has been by Big Sister and I have been her Little Sister. I annoy her almost on a daily basis and have gotten closer to each other over the years. Kamna and Ryan, I can’t wait for your big day and so glad to be here with you to celebrate it! Forever #HappilyAberAfter!</p>

								<p>I've known Kamna for over three years (of course we met through her love for TMP, in case you were wondering!) and immediately connected with her from the start! As our friendship grew, I quickly realized how loving she could really be and how far she'll go to help anyone that she cares for. I'm so excited to be by her side throughout her whole wedding process, can't wait to make even more memories! </p>

								<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
								<p>I met Kamna 4 years ago through my fiance and was instantly drawn to her carefree and loud personality. Anyone who knows Kamna can testify to this. We quickly became really good friends which was not hard at all because of Kamna's easy going personality. When she first told me about Ryan, I saw a spark in her eyes that showed how much she cared for him. Ryan had everything Kamna was looking for and it was amazing to see the two of them grow in their relationship. I cannot put into words how happy I am for the two of them and cannot wait to celebrate these two!</p>

								<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
								<p>The first semester of college, at Pennsylvania State University, I met Kamna Gupta. Eventually her effervescent personality and love for bollywood began to melt my "don't mess with me" attitude. Before I knew it, Kamna became my partner in crime, my ride or die, the Bonnie to my Clyde. Kamna has become an integral part of my family and I could not be happier that she has met a fabulous guy like Ryan. We have always enjoyed finding unique parallelisms and links between our lives. Like the fact both of our mom's are named Anu and graduates of Gargi College in New Delhi, India. During our time at Penn State my aunt lived less than a five minute drive from Kamna's home, allowing us to spend every winter break together! We both then graduated our prospective graduate programs the same year and took a celebratory trip to Napa Valley. And since Kamna's family is full of dentists, it would be fitting for her best friend to be a dentist as well. Finally, I could not be happier than the fact we will be getting married one week apart in September of 2016! Wishing you and Ryan all the happiness, and I hope your love for each other grows with each passing year. Cannot wait to take trips to celebrate our anniversaries together in the future! &hearts;</p>

							<p>Kamna and I met in 2012 when she took me on as a board member of The Manhattan project. It didn't take long for me to see past her OCD and awkward ways to see what a loyal and genuine friend she is. We have had the joy to go through so many pivotal moments in our lives together and am looking forward to being be her side on her wedding day! Kamna, here is to many more years of Ryan and I coaching you through life! </p>

						<h5>Bridesmaid</h5>
						<p>I first met Kamna during college, when we were both on Penn State's fusion dance team, Dishoom. From frequent late-night dance practices and food runs to working sweat-shop-style in my apartment, sewing glittery costumes for our competitions, we spent a lot of time together. After college, Kamna and I kept in touch and I'd always see her when I came home from medical school in North Carolina. However, when I really got to know Kamna best was once we moved in together in Philadelphia in 2013. I remember I had texted Kamna to ask her if she knew anybody that was looking for a roommate in Philadelphia since I was moving there for residency. She was living in the suburbs in King of Prussia at the time and texted back and said, "Nope! Sorry!" And then a few hours later..."Wait, what if I move in with you?" As far as I know, she had no intention of moving to Philadelphia before my text, but in typical Kamna fashion, figured why not. I've always loved Kamna's spontaneity and I'm glad she chose to be spontaneous in that case. It's been great getting to know Kamna even better over the last few years and watching her fall in love with Ryan. They complement each other in so many ways and are perfect together. Although I may be sad to lose Kamna to the suburbs again, I'm so excited for the two of them as they take this next step together and honored to be part of their big day! </p>
