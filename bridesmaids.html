									<h6>Bridesmaid</h6>
									<p>I first met Kamna during college, when we were both on Penn State's fusion dance team, Dishoom. From frequent late-night dance practices and food runs to working sweat-shop-style in my apartment, sewing glittery costumes for our competitions, we spent a lot of time together. After college, Kamna and I kept in touch and I'd always see her when I came home from medical school in North Carolina. However, when I really got to know Kamna best was once we moved in together in Philadelphia in 2013. I remember I had texted Kamna to ask her if she knew anybody that was looking for a roommate in Philadelphia since I was moving there for residency. She was living in the suburbs in King of Prussia at the time and texted back and said, "Nope! Sorry!" And then a few hours later..."Wait, what if I move in with you?" As far as I know, she had no intention of moving to Philadelphia before my text, but in typical Kamna fashion, figured why not. I've always loved Kamna's spontaneity and I'm glad she chose to be spontaneous in that case. It's been great getting to know Kamna even better over the last few years and watching her fall in love with Ryan. They complement each other in so many ways and are perfect together. Although I may be sad to lose Kamna to the suburbs again, I'm so excited for the two of them as they take this next step together and honored to be part of their big day!</p>

				 					<p>Since I met Kamna my freshman year of college at Penn State, she has been nothing short than an older sister and role model to me. From my education goals to my career choices of pursuing my nursing dreams, she has been rooting for me and offered every bit of advice and assistance along the way. Despite having our own lives and sometimes not seeing each other for months, she never makes it feel like a day has gone by where I haven't talked to her. Every catch up, and every meeting make it feel like we never stopped talking.I am elated that I am able to share yet another event with her, and this being one of the best days of her lives, I am so excited for her to take the next step into her future as MRS. Abraham. "Our paths may change as life goes on, but the bond between friends remains ever strong." -Unknown</p>

									<h6>Bridesmaid</h6>
									<p>The first semester of college, at Pennsylvania State University, I met Kamna Gupta. Eventually her effervescent personality and love for bollywood began to melt my "don't mess with me" attitude. Before I knew it, Kamna became my partner in crime, my ride or die, the Bonnie to my Clyde. Kamna has become an integral part of my family and I could not be happier that she has met a fabulous guy like Ryan. We have always enjoyed finding unique parallelisms and links between our lives. Like the fact both of our mom's are named Anu and graduates of Gargi College in New Delhi, India. During our time at Penn State my aunt lived less than a five minute drive from Kamna's home, allowing us to spend every winter break together! We both then graduated our prospective graduate programs the same year and took a celebratory trip to Napa Valley. And since Kamna's family is full of dentists, it would be fitting for her best friend to be a dentist as well. Finally, I could not be happier than the fact we will be getting married one week apart in September of 2016! Wishing you and Ryan all the happiness, and I hope your love for each other grows with each passing year. Cannot wait to take trips to celebrate our anniversaries together in the future! <3</p>

				 					<p>I'm happy to say I'll be joining this beautiful couple on their wedding day. My name is Erica and I'm from Klingerstown, PA (don't worry, no one has ever heard of it). I grew up on farm lands, so moving to the Philadelphia area was certainly a culture shock. Working for Johnson & Johnson brought me to meet Kamna and what a blessing that was. Finding someone with the same quirky humor I have, is rare. In my spare time, I love working out, CrossFit especially. My friends call me a fashionista and I own that title every day ;) Spending time with my friends is key. I'd rather put the phones away and chat then be on social media all day, that's quality time. I'm SUPER pumped to celebrate this special time and can't wait to meet everyone soon!!!!!!! XOXO-Erica</p>
