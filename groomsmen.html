		<p>Abe and I met through mutual friends while I was living in Conshy in 2008.  Abe and I have been conquering the world together, one Spartan Race at a time, since 2013.</p>

		<h4>Dave Volpe</h4>
		<h5>Groomsman</h5>
		<p>After college, I bumped into Riordan (we went to Penn State together) in Conshy.  He invited me to hang out with his roommates at their house in King of Prussia: one of them was Abe. I instantly knew Abe was good people, because he fit right in with our weird group of friends.  A short time later, I was glad to learn that Riodan and Abe moved into a house in Conshy on my street.   We are Team Boccilism teammates for life, but we've also spent countless hours playing guitar hero and "throwey ball" on the wii while talking about fantasy football.   Abe's pool on 12th avenue was a magical place.  One of the first times I ever spoke to my wife was there, and the huge amount of time that Abe and I spent there together made our friendship rock solid for years.  </p>

		<p>Being Ryan's older brother,  I've had the privilege of knowing him his entire life. I got to see him grow up and become the person he is today. And it couldn't make me happier that Ryan and Kamna have found each other.</p>

		<h5>Groomsman</h5>
		<p>Kevin's first memory of Abe was when he visited Mike Riordan's apartment in Conshy and met his roommate who had hockey equipment so smelly that it had to be left outside.  Since that first encounter, Abe's friendship with Kevin (much like his odor) has only improved.  Now, they can be spotted on the bocce court together racking up victories for team Boccilism.</p>

		<h5>Groomsman</h5>
		<p>We met in college years through mutual friends, Tim and Rich. Matty would not stay away from SHIP! Our friendship was solidified with a spontaneous last minute roadtrip to Boston and Maine. Roommates in Horsham. Neighborhood neighbors in Conshy!</p>

		<h5>Groomsman</h5>
		<p>I met Abe when he and Mike Riordan lived together in King of Prussia.  The Eagles were in the playoffs and they were having people over to watch the game.  We knew Mike from Penn State and he invited us.  Dave had met Abe before and when I asked him who Abe was he said, "You're going to like him, he's just like us." And right he was.  Almost a decade later we're still great friends.</p>

		<h5>Groomsman</h5>
		<p>Some say the legend of Ryan and Michael's friendship began way back in-utero, while their mothers, already friends, did a stomach bump (like a chest bump between football players, only with their baby bumps) and declared "these boys will be best friends for life!"  Forced together at a young age, the bounds of their friendship would know no borders.  They've survived thick and thin, from childhood best friends, to college shenanigans and even roommates in their post graduate early careers.  Sharing a strong bond, the heights of mischief they have achieved together would make frat boys blush, and are too sultry to share - tucked away into the deep recesses of their memories.  But from time to time, as life wears on, they'll get together and revel in the stories of their youth, the hijinks survived, and ramble on about the adventures that lie ahead...</p>

		<h4>Patrick Murphy</h4>
		<h5>Groomsman</h5>
		<p>When I met Abe my first thought was “This potential friendship is like a hanging curve. You have to go deep.” We bonded during our years together in Conshohocken over many things, including our mutual love of hiding old Christmas trees under cars, the innuendo-filled adventures of Doogie Howser, sushi, going to law/business school mostly to meet women and the realization that his first name is neither Abe nor Ryan. I like to think that I didn’t become good friends with Abe solely because he had access to a swimming pool, but it didn’t hurt.</p>

		<p>While living in Hoboken, I started dating my now wife, Amanda, and quickly became friends with all of her friends where she was living, in Conshohocken, when I would be visiting every other weekend. I met Abe at a 3rd street house on New Years Eve. We cemented our friendship while playing on a Manayunk League softball team!</p>

		<h5>Groomsman</h5>
		<p>I met Ryan playing hockey at THE Shippensburg University. Since college, we have been roommates in both Horsham and King of Prussia and threw some epic parties in the process (Freedom Fest and the Galas to name a couple). We lived with separate roommates when we got to Conshy, but still remained close and met a lot of new friends along the way...most of the groomsen actually. Abe some how swung a pool in Conshy for a couple years, and they were probably the best. Ha. I'm thrilled to be a part of his and Kamna's big day!
